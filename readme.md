# Queue Management System

This program implements a queue management system for a shop with 3 cashiers. Each queue can have a maximum of 2, 3, and 5 customers, respectively. The following functionalities are implemented as separate procedures:

-   Add customer to queue
-   Serve customer
-   Get queue status
-   Get stock level
-   Display warning message when stock level is low

The shop has exactly 100 pizzas in stock. For each customer added to the queue, the stock level is updated. Each customer is served 10 pizzas. A warning message is displayed when the stock level reaches 20 pizzas.
